The streets began to fill with the sounds of shattering glass, fire, and screams. That night, and into the next day, nearly 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses were smashed, hundreds of synagogues were burned, and thousands of Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.\\n\\nWhat triggered this violent outbreak?\\n\\nA 17-year-old Jewish boy named Herschel Grynszpan, upset by the Nazi deportation of his family, had shot a German diplomat in Paris. The Nazi leadership used it as a pretext to unleash a coordinated, nationwide attack on the Jewish community.\\n\\nThe event was deceptively called Kristallnacht, or \"The Night of Broken Glass\" â€” referencing the glass from all the shattered shop windows. But what really broke that night wasn\\'t just glass: it was the last illusion that German Jews could safely live under Nazi rule.\\n\\nAfter Kristallnacht, there was no doubt: the Nazi regime\\'s goal was not discriminationâ€”it was destruction. This moment became a turning point in the Holocaust, foreshadowing the horrors to come.')]"
