In Germany, on the night of November 9, 1938, a quiet dread filled the air. The streets began to fill with the sounds of shattering glass, fire, and screams. That night, and into the next day, nearly 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses were smashed, hundreds of synagogues were burned, and thousands of Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.

What triggered this violent outbreak?

A 17-year-old Jewish boy named Herschel Grynszpan, upset by the Nazi deportation of his family, had shot a German diplomat in Paris. The Nazi leadership used it as a pretext to unleash a coordinated, nationwide attack on the Jewish community.

The event was deceptively called Kristallnacht, or "The Night of Broken Glass" — referencing the glass from all the shattered shop windows. But what really broke that night wasn't just glass: it was the last illusion that German Jews could safely live under Nazi rule.

After Kristallnacht, there was no doubt: the Nazi regime's goal was not discrimination—it was destruction. This moment became a turning point in the Holocaust, foreshadowing the horrors to come.
